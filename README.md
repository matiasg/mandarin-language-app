A vibe-coding app done by [Manus](https://manus.im/) with small tweaks/fixes from me.
I just did it to learn Chinese (mandarin) characters.

### install / run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install pnpm if you don't already have it. In arch linux it's just 
```sh
pacman -S pnpm
```
3. Install
```sh
pnpm install
```
4. Run
```sh
pnpm run dev
```
5. Open it in your browser, in [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

### disclaimers
- I know almost nothing of Chinese. My only knowledge comes from 2 months of Duolingo.
- I know almost nothing of javascript. That language was Manus's choice.
